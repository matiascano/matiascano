# Hi I'm Matías 👋

I'm a UX/UI designer from Argentina, actually I work at the 🏢 Municipality of General Pueyrredon.

I belong to the Municipal Accessibility Plan, (PLAMAC) ♿ , and I work in the Digital Gobervment area.

I like to try new flavors, not only in food 🍕, but also on trips ✈️ and at work 🚀.

🔥 I am a food lover, a while ago I studied gastronomy. I always try to use this ability to share with friends and family.
